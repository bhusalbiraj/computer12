			<h2>Types of Database Models</h2>
			<p>A database model is a conceptual representation of the structure and organization of a database.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Hierarchical Model</strong>: A hierarchical model is a database model that organizes data in a tree-like structure, with each record having a single parent record.</li>
				<li><strong>Network Model</strong>: A network model is a database model that allows each record to have multiple parent and child records, forming a network of relationships.</li>
				<li><strong>Relational Model</strong>: A relational model is a database model that organizes data into tables with well-defined relationships between them.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Relational Model</h2>
			<p>A relational model is a database model that organizes data into tables with well-defined relationships between them.</p>
			<h2>Types of Relationships</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>One-to-One (1:1)</strong>: A one-to-one relationship is a relationship between two tables where each record in one table is related to only one record in the other table.</li>
				<li><strong>One-to-Many (1:N)</strong>: A one-to-many relationship is a relationship between two tables where each record in one table is related to multiple records in the other table.</li>
				<li><strong>Many-to-Many (M:N)</strong>: A many-to-many relationship is a relationship between two tables where each record in one table is related to multiple records in the other table, and vice versa.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Example of Relational Model</h2>
			<p>Consider a database that stores information about customers and orders. The relational model would organize this data into two tables: Customers and Orders.</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Customers</th>
					<th>Orders</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Customer ID</td>
					<td>Order ID</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Customer Name</td>
					<td>Order Date</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Address</td>
					<td>Total Amount</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
